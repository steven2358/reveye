This extension allows to perform an inverse image search by right-clicking onto any image in a web site.

The context menu can be configured to contain either a single button with the default search engine, or a cascaded menu with all included search engines. Custom search engines can be added by the user (see below).

## Install

Stable version: Go to the [Google Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keaaclcjhehbbapnphnmpiklalfhelgf) and click "Add to Chrome".

Development version: [Download the source from GitHub](https://github.com/steven2358/reveye/archive/master.zip) and [load the extension into Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked).

## Adding user-defined search engines

To add a custom search engine, open the extension options page and click on the "Add custom engine" button. Fill in the name and URL of the search engine (use `%s` as a placeholder for the image URL). For example, to add SauceNAO, fill in the following values:
- Name: `SauceNAO`
- URL: `https://saucenao.com/search.php?url=%s`

 Make sure the check box is checked and click "Save". The search engine will be added to the context menu.
